# Simple Shared Wallet

Simple shared wallet contract enables you to store ERC20 tokens and Ethereum funds which can be accessed and managed by not only you (the contract owner) but also several other admin wallets. This reduces your risk exposure as you are not relying on the owner wallet only as this could possibly be a single point of failure. This is not an alternative to or a replacement of multi-sig wallets.

**Other Use Cases**

This contract could also be useful for smart contract developers if you want to protect your client's funds by managing tokens and Ethereum in a smart contract which can also be accessed by other admin wallets when you are unavailable.

## Features

- Store ERC20 compatible token and Ethereum in the contract.
- Admins can transfer the tokens held in the contract to any wallet.
- The owner can define the maximum value limit of token or Ethereum transfer per transaction.
- Admins can perform bulk transfer to save gas.
- Admins can pause the contract in case of emergency.
- Admins can assign other admins to perform token or Ethereum transfers.
- The owner can assign a trustee wallet which will be able to change the owner in case of emergency.
- etc
