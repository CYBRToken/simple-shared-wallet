Collection of functions related to the address type,

## Functions

- [isContract(address account)](#iscontract)

### isContract

Returns true if `account` is a contract.
     * This test is non-exhaustive, and there may be false-negatives: during the
execution of a contract's constructor, its address will be reported as
not containing a contract.
     * > It is unsafe to assume that an address for which this function returns
false is an externally-owned account (EOA) and not a contract.

```js
function isContract(address account) internal view
returns(bool)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| account | address |  |
